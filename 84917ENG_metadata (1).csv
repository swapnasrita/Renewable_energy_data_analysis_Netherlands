This table expresses the use of renewable energy as gross final consumption of energy. Figures are presented in an absolute way, as well as related to the total energy use in the Netherlands.
The total gross final energy consumption in the Netherlands (the denominator used to calculate the percentage of renewable energy per ‘Energy sources and techniques’) can be found in the table as ‘Total, including non-renewables’ and Energy application ‘Total’. 
The gross final energy consumption for the energy applications ‘Electricity’ and ‘Heat’ are also available. With these figures the percentages of the different energy sources and applications can be calculated; these values are not available in this table. 
The gross final energy consumption for ‘Transport’ is not available because of the complexity to calculate this. More information on this can be found in the yearly publication ‘Hernieuwbare energie in Nederland’.

Renewable energy is energy from wind, hydro power, the sun, the earth, heat from outdoor air and biomass. This is energy from natural processes that is replenished constantly.

The figures are broken down into energy source/technique and into energy application (electricity, heat and transport).

This table focuses on the share of renewable energy according to the EU Renewable Energy Directive. Under this directive, countries can apply an administrative transfer by purchasing renewable energy from countries that have consumed more renewable energy than the agreed target. For 2020, the Netherlands has implemented such a transfer by purchasing renewable energy from Denmark. This transfer has been made visible in this table as a separate energy source/technique and two totals are included; a total with statistical transfer and a total without statistical transfer.

Figures for 2020 and before were calculated based on RED I; in accordance with Eurostat these figures will not be modified anymore. Inconsistencies with other tables undergoing updates may occur.

Data available from:
1990

Status of the figures:
This table contains definite figures up to and including 2022 and figures of 2023 are revised provisional figures. 

Changes as of November 15th 2024
Figures for 2021-2023 have been adjusted. 2022 is now definitive, 2023 stays revised provisional. Because of new insights for windmills regarding own electricity use and capacity, figures on 2021 have been revised.


Changes as of June 7th 2024
Revised provisional figures of 2023 have been added.

Changes as of March 2024:
Figures of the total energy applications of biogas, co-digestion of manure and other biogas have been restored for 2021 and 2022. The final energy consumption of non-compliant biogas (according to RED II) was wrongly included in the total final consumption of these types of biogas. Figures of total biogas, total biomass and total renewable energy were not influenced by this and therefore not adjusted. 

Changes as of November 2023:
Figures of 2021 and 2022 have been updated. The status for figures of 2021 is now definite and the status for figures of 2022 is revised provisional.
A new category /""/Total, including non-renewables/""/ has been added from 1990 and further. Also the category /""/Biokerosene/""/ has been added since 2022.


When will new figures be published?
Provisional figures on the gross final consumption of renewable energy in broad outlines for the previous year are published each year in June. Revised provisional figures for the previous year appear each year in June.

In November all figures on the consumption of renewable energy in the previous year will be published. These figures remain revised provisional, definite figures appear in November two years after the reporting year. Most important (expected) changes between revised provisional figures in November and definite figures a year later are the figures on solar photovoltaic energy. The figures on the share of total energy consumption in the Netherlands could also still be changed by the availability of adjusted figures on total energy consumption.

The method for computing solar photovoltaic energy is changed in 2018 and led to a revision of figures for 2012-2017. The new method is published in an article <a href='https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/onze-diensten/methoden/onderzoeksomschrijvingen/korte-onderzoeksbeschrijvingen/zonnestroom-op-regionaal-niveau'>Zonnestroom op regionaal niveau</a> (Dutch only).

Deep geothermal energy is heat that comes from inside the earth’s core. Deep geothermal heat is mainly used using a heat exchanger. A heat exchanger is a device in which two streams come together with different temperatures in which heat transfer takes place from the flow with the high temperature to the low temperature stream. A heat exchanger, unlike a heat pump, requires very little auxiliary energy.
